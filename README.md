### Project Overview
This project dives into a gender lens on water access in fictional African country called Maji Ndogo. We'll analyze survey data to reveal inequalities, understand their impacts, and recommend solutions to achieve fairer water access for all, especially women and girls. Join us to make a splash for gender equality!

### Data Source
- Md_summary.csv
- Md_queue_related_crime.csv
- MD_Provinces.json
  
Note that the csv and json files will not be available here, due to copywrite issues.

### Tools
- Power BI

### Steps for Creating the Power Bi Report
- Step 1: Import the CSV files into Power BI. Make sure you check that the data has the correct format in the Table view.
- Step 2: Let's start with our national-level results. We're going to make a couple of visuals on the same page that communicate the results of the survey at a high level.
- Step 3: Since Maji Ndogo isn't well known, we have to use a custom map to visualise the data on a new page.
- Step 4: Create a new Power BI page and add the following visuals: Added a bar chart visual with average queue times, created a line chart that plots the average queue times for the hour of the day, created a bar chart that shows the average composition of queues for each day of the week and created a scatter plot with number_of_people_served vs. Average of time_in_queue.
- Step 5: Visualised the number of crimes committed by type, province and type, split by victim gender.

### 5 Key questions to Investigate
1. What is the percentage of people living in the rural parts of Maji Ndogo?
2. What is the number of people using shared taps in the urban areas of Maji Ndogo?
3. What days are the proportions of women and men in queues are more equally distributed?
4. Which crimes are women the most likely to be affected by?
5. Which province in Maji Ndogo has the lowest number of crimes against women?

### Findings/Results
1. The percentage of people living in the rural parts of Maji Ndogo IS **63.85%**
2. The number of people using shared taps in the urban areas of Maji Ndogo is close to **3 million** people.
3. On weekends (Saturday-Sunday), the proportions of women and men in queues are more equally distributed than on weekdays.
4. Women a most likey to be **harassed** while collecting water.
5. Amanzi province has **lowest number of crimes**.
